	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The Time complexity is the number of operations an algorithm performs to complete its task (considering that each operation takes the same amount of time). The algorithm that performs the task in the smallest number of operations is considered the most efficient one in terms.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> is a measurement of the amount of memory that an algorithm or operation needs to run according to its input size. It is the sum of auxiliary space and the memory used by input variables.For example, if we want to initialize an array of n integers, then it would be O(n).</p>
